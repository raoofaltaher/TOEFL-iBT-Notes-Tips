## Reading Section Tips and Notes

### 1. Identify the Question Type

- Tailor your strategy based on the specific type of question.

---

### 2. Enhance Vocabulary
- Study the 570 vocabulary words for better comprehension, particularly for scientific and academic texts.

---

### 3. Learn Active Reading Skills
- **Definition**: Active reading involves reading with a specific goal in mind rather than trying to understand the entire passage.
- **Purpose**: Focus on identifying key points, solutions, or information relevant to the question.

---

### 4. Time Management

  - Require deriving implied or suggested information not explicitly stated in the passage.
- **Other Questions**:
